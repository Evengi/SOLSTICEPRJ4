          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Colour scheme&nbsp; <em>:</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #130D30;"></span>
              #130D30 <em> Dark Blue </em> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F0C404;"></span>
              #F0C404
              <em> Yellow </em>

              #FFFFFF
              <em> White </em><br><br>
			  <p> The colour scheme is based on a primary dark blue colour that fits the theme of a cruise in the open sea, while a secondary bright yellow colour provides warmth and good contrast and is a fun visual touch to the eye. White lettering is used for the primary text to ensure readability on the dark blue background. In the end of the home page, we see big white rectangles, that is where we want to lead the users to after looking at the text. We also have white on our images to create consistency and see the colour in a few places throughout the website.</p> 
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
			  <li> Logo </li>
			  <img src="img/logo.svg" alt="Logo Solstice" class="logo-landpage">
			  <p>Our logo is a dark blue circle that has yellow wavy and circular shapes inside. The wavy lines represent the waves and the circle the sun above the dark blue water.</p>
            <li>Font choices </li><br> 
			  <p>
			  For our brand name we chose font Rosella Engraved, its sharp edges create a nice contrast with the circular logo and allow our two main colours to fill in the letters making them more distinctive and eye-catching. For subtitles we use Aviano, it’s similar to Rosella but simpler, it shows hierarchy with Rosella being the main font and … being a sub font. For the main text we use New Order that again has rounder letters that complement the round edge rectangles that portray the donation tiles. The choice of fonts is based on creating a consistent look and feel throughout the website while ensuring readability and visual appeal. </p>
			  <li> User interface elements </li> 
				<p>We use buttons and hyperlinks within the website to seamlessly navigate the user through the website, in order to make it highly functional. For instance, the navbar is fully interactable, providing easy access to every section of the home and about pages. Additionally, there is a Contribute here buttons on each donation tile. When clicked, a pop-up appears on the screen, which makes it easy for users to donate without leaving the page. Lastly, we have a Send button at the end of the contact section that sends the written message to the email of the brand.<br><br>
The image gallery element uses hover controls that show the brand values that correspond to the specific photographs, which makes the website look cleaner, more visual, and less text heavy. Additionally the value images are clickable, directly redirecting the user to the values section of the website.<br><br>
There are also hyperlinks connected to the contact details, for example, when you click the email, it automatically opens your personal email or if you click the phone number you can immediately call the brand.<br><br>
We also make use of a carousel in the about page. It is entirely automated without button controls in order not to divert the intention from the important brand information. The imagery chosen for the carousel is previously used in the home page, which is done in order to establish our product an brand imagery in the minds of the consumer more predominantly.<br>
<br>					
We use a Form that contains Text fields for users to be able to fill in their name, email, and amount of money to donate, when they click on the donate tiles. After they are going to be redirected to their bank. This is a very simple form with only three easy fields to fill in, so our users feel that the process of donating is easy and fast, without requiring too much personal information.<br><br>
We used these simple interface elements since our target audience consists of middle-aged singles located on the Balkan peninsula, specifically Bulgaria and Romania. Our target group is generally not very fond of complicated designs and leading elements, so we went for the straight to the point, clear elements that are easy to navigate.<br><br>

			  <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> </li> <br>
				<ul>
            <li>Home page</li>
			  <p> First thing the user sees in the hero section of the home page is the logo and the brand name, accompanied by our vision and mission, and a picture of our ship. Next, by scrolling down, is a captivating copy of what our service consists of, accompanied by images to form a clear picture in the user’s mind. In the end of the product description come our image gallery representing our brand values. Only the main crucial part is portrayed on the Home page, and by clicking on the pictures the user is redirected to the About page where the rest of the content can be found. As for the crowdfunding part, it is again positioned on the Home page, but at the bottom. That way, it is not straight in the user’s face but at the same time it is not hidden in a different page and doesn’t require additional clicks to be found, only scrolling. In the end of the home page the contact information is situated. </p>
            <li>About page</li>
			  <p>The About Us page is where users can find all the additional information – about the product, the values, and the team behind the brand. It starts with a carousel that shows different shots of our ship. It is a diversifying element given that this page consists of mainly text. Right under is all the detailed information and the copy for our values. By scrolling to the bottom of the page users can find the team, and under – footer with hyperlinked contact icons.  </p>

  <p>
</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our testing <strong>goals</strong><br>

				<p>Through our testing we aim to find out how functional the website is, how intuitive it is to navigate and find desired items and sections, all the while gathering info about the visual appeal of the brand website. We want to gain insight on which features are liked by our demographic and which ones are not in order to know what to emphasize on for future developments </p>

				</li>
           		 <li>Testing <strong>methods</strong>
              <ul>
                <li> Test Participants<br><br>
                We tested with 3 people from our target group – middle aged singles from the Balkan Peninsula. However, we also wanted to see how a young person (19) - a kid of a middle aged single, would interact with our website and what impressions would it leave on him. This is because from our interviews we saw that most people from our audience have children around this age and they consult with them since they are more in the online environment and parents use them as a trustful source of information about events and travel. Given that, we wanted to make sure that our website is also suitable and easy to navigate and interact with also by young adults, since they directly can affect  our target audience. Overall we find that input from our target audience is the most valuable hence the higher number of participants</li>
                <br>
                <li> Test Setting<br>
				<br>
					We conducted our user-testing via online platforms, since this would enable us to see how our target audience would interact with out website in a regular day-to-day situation on their own devices. However we found it valuable to also have one of testing sessions in a live setting where the user did the test through the developer's device. This was done in order to ensure that at least one of the tests had input from users regarding the website they way us, the developers see it on our devices.k</li><br>
                <li>The test protocol </li><br>
				  The following instructions were given to our participants in order to ensure they navigate through every section of the website and interact with every feature.<br><br>
				  1.	Find the product description
					<br>2.	Find the values in two different ways
					<br>3.	Find the team
					<br>4.	Send us a message
					<br>5.	Donate 600 euros<br><br>
				  Three of the tests were recorded via screen recording with the participants sharing their screens and with the camera turned on. This was done in order for us to be able to thoroughly observe their behavier and reactions to the website and its features. The last one was done live and a video was taken of the user interacting with the site <br>
              </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Testing results:
              <ul>
                <li>Main Findings</li>
				  	1.	Adjust the color scheme: Consider using warmer and brighter colors instead of dark blue. Use yellow or other warm colors that bring a sense of friendliness and approachability to the website. <br>
				  	
				  	This would be considered in future activities since our main pallette seems to set users off instead of attracting them <br><br>
					2.	Increase font size and use keywords: Increase the font size of the text and highlight important keywords to make it easier for users to read and understand the content. <br>
					
					For future activites we must identify what we want to emphasize on and make sure it stands out among the clutter of text<br><br>
					3.	Reduce the number of tabs: Simplify the About page by reducing the number of tabs that are open when a user clicks on it. Consider organizing the content in a more intuitive and user-friendly way.<br>
					This improvement has been made in the final version of the website - the about page no longer opens in a new tab.<br><br>
					4.	Add dynamic elements: Incorporate graphics and interactive elements to make the website more dynamic and engaging for users. This could include animations, videos, or other multimedia content.<br>
					This would be considered for future improvements - animate content as it loads in, additional popups, video content etc.<br><br>
					5.	Make sure the website matches the service: Ensure that the website accurately reflects the service being offered. The website should convey the unique value proposition and benefits of the service in a better way.<br>This goes hand in hand with the previous point. In order to make our website stand out, to differentiate it from the rest we would need to include more advanced and dynamic UI features.
					<br><br>
					6.	Reduce the amount of text: Simplify the content by using clear and concise language that is easy for users to understand. Use bullet points, headings, and other formatting techniques to break up long blocks of text.<br> This would potentially be implemented alongside the more advanced visual feaures since they would allow us to break up the text and make it less monotonous.
					<br><br>
					7.	Improve navigation: Make sure the website is easy to navigate and intuitive for users. Reorder the navigation bar pages to make more sense and ensure that icons are used to make it easier for users to understand where they are on the site.<br>These changes to the navbar have been taken into account and implemented in the latest version of the website
					<br><br>
					8.	Fix the contact form: Ensure that the contact form works properly and does not give errors when information is not entered correctly. <br> Further research into JavaScript and interactive forms and popups is required for us to ensure that misinput is avoided and the error is prevented.

  <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h3 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
          <p>In order to achieve our campaign objectives, we at Solstice, have carefully crafted our messaging to resonate with our target audience. Our focus on the theme of "Choice" is intended to empower middle-aged singles to take control of their lives and pursue the relationships and experiences that they desire. <br>
<br>
To ensure that our messaging is effective, we have enlisted the help of brand ambassadors who are themselves members of our target audience. These ambassadors help to further spread our message by sharing our posts on their own Facebook pages, thereby increasing our reach and engaging with more people. Our plan is to post Mondays and Fridays and allow the ambassadors to post on Saturdays and Sundays. Through this we have four consecutive days of posting which should produce a larger user engagement throughout the week. <br><br>

To maximize the impact of our campaign, we want to utilize Facebook's targeting options to reach our desired audience based on key demographics, interests, and behaviors. By doing so, we can ensure that our messaging is reaching those who are most likely to be interested in our brand and its offerings.<br><br>

To measure the success of our campaign, we have set specific goals for reach and engagement. Our target is to reach at least 50 people from our target audience and generate on average 75 post interactions. By monitoring our campaign performance closely and making adjustments as necessary, we are confident that we can achieve these goals and create a lasting impact on our target audience.<br><br>

The reactions that our posts receive, such as likes, loves, and wows, can provide valuable feedback on how our messaging is resonating with our target audience. A post that receives a high number of likes and loves indicates that it is being well received and resonating with our audience, while a post that receives a low number of reactions may indicate that we need to adjust our messaging or targeting.<br><br>

The reactions on our posts can also serve as a way to build social proof, which is an important factor in consumer decision making. When our posts receive a high number of positive reactions, such as likes and loves, it can create a sense of social validation and encourage others to engage with our brand and its offerings
By closely monitoring the reactions on our posts, we can gain valuable insights into how our target audience is responding to our messaging and make adjustments as necessary. This can help us to optimize our campaign performance and achieve our goals of reaching at least 50 people from our target audience and generating on average 75 post interactions.<br><br>

In addition to measuring post reactions, we will also monitor the comments and shares on our Facebook posts as part of our response objectives. Comments and shares can provide valuable feedback and insights into how our target audience is engaging with our brand and messaging. We monitor the comments section for any negative feedback or comments and address them promptly and respectfully.<br><br>

For shares, our response objectives include monitoring the number of shares our posts receive as an indicator of their relevance and resonance with our target audience, tracking the sentiment of shared posts and engaging with users who have shared our content with positive feedback or comments and encouraging more shares by creating content that is shareable and easily digestible, and by including clear calls-to-action that prompt users to share with their networks.<br><br>

By monitoring comments and shares on our Facebook posts, we can gain valuable insights into how our target audience is engaging with our brand and messaging and adjust our strategy as necessary.<br><br>

To further expand our reach and engagement on Facebook, we will also include relevant hashtags in our posts as part of our social media strategy. Hashtags can help our content get discovered by users who are searching for specific topics or keywords on Facebook.<br><br>
			  

Our hashtag strategy will include researching and identifying relevant and popular hashtags within our target audience's interests and behaviors. We also incorporate 3-4 hashtags per post that are relevant to the content and align with our brand's messaging and personality. Lastly, we encourage users to use our branded hashtag in their own posts and user-generated content to increase brand awareness and engagement.<br><br>

By strategically using hashtags in our Facebook posts, we can increase our visibility and reach to users who may not be following our brand's page, but are interested in the topics we are discussing. Additionally, by creating a branded hashtag, we can encourage our target audience to engage with our brand and share their experiences and perspectives with others.<br><br>

Overall, our Marketing Communication campaign on Facebook is designed to empower and inspire middle-aged singles to embrace their independence and pursue their desired relationships and experiences. By delivering relevant and engaging messaging through a variety of formats, and utilizing Facebook's targeting options and brand ambassadors, we are confident that we can achieve our campaign objectives and create a lasting impact on our target audience.<br><br>
          </p>
		<h4> <em>Target audience</em>  </h4>	
			<p>Our target audience is middle-aged singles between the ages of 35-60. This demographic is active on social media, as they are at a stage in their lives where they are looking for new connections and experiences.<br><br>
				
In terms of media behavior, our target audience uses a variety of social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. They also use dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble to meet new people. However, Facebook is the most popular platform among our target audience, as it is a well-established social media platform with a diverse user base.<br><br>
				
To position our message effectively, we need to understand our target audience's interests and preferences. We will focus on creating content that speaks directly to their needs and aspirations and use a tone that is friendly and relatable. Our messaging will highlight the benefits of being independent and embracing choice and inspire our target audience to take action towards finding new connections and experiences.<br><br>
				
Our target audience visits social media platforms during their free time, which is in the evenings or on weekends. We aim to post content during these times to maximize engagement and reach.
By understanding our target audience's media behavior, interests, and values, we can create a marketing communication campaign that resonates with them and inspires them to take action towards finding new connections and experiences.
</p>
          <h3 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Execution and Learning Points </h3>
          <p>The list of shortcomings we have identified in our social media strategy is quite extensive, and it's clear that we have a lot of room for improvement.<br>
<br>
 Perhaps the most significant issue is our overestimation of Facebook's algorithm, especially when compared to newer platforms like Instagram and TikTok. This has likely contributed to a lack of engagement and reach on our posts, which in turn has hindered our ability to connect with our target audience.<br><br>
			  
Another area where we have fallen short is our frequency of posting. By not posting often enough, we are missing out on valuable opportunities to engage with our followers and build a relationship with them. Additionally, by not posting at the designated timeslots that are most efficient for our target audience, we are missing out on potential engagement and reach. To be more specific, we didn’t post in all the four consecutive days throughout the execution weeks. <br><br>
			  
While we have been relying heavily on ambassador posts to drive engagement, we recognize that this is not enough to sustain a successful social media campaign. The ambassador shared posts from their personal life, which perfectly captured the essence of our values and brand. Furthermore, we have not been utilizing ambassadors who have company accounts, as we do not have access to their analytics. This is a missed opportunity, as these accounts could potentially drive significant traffic to our brand page.<br><br>
			  
Yet, we should have diversified our content and incorporated various forms, such as videos, quizzes, and other interactive features, to keep our audience engaged and interested. We, as a brand, didn’t have any interactive messages, such as videos or quizzes, and we only posted pictures with captions. Due to the fact that we stuck with the same material, we didn’t receive the attention we hoped for. It became monotonous and we should have diversified our content to increase the engagement.<br><br>
			  
We still don’t have a post that outreached the previous ones, which means that we still haven’t found the proper way to communicate with our target audience.<br><br>
			  
Furthermore, we have not been using explicit call-to-action messages in our ambassador posts, which is a crucial aspect of any successful social media campaign. By failing to include clear instructions on what our audience should do after reading our posts, we are not effectively generating traffic to our brand page.<br><br>
			  
In summary, we have identified several areas where our social media strategy needs improvement. We recognize the importance of adapting to the changing social media landscape and utilizing a diverse range of content formats to engage with our target audience effectively. We will continue to monitor our strategy closely and optimize it as necessary to ensure we are delivering the best possible results for our brand.<br><br>

Despite some areas for improvement, there were also some positive learning points that emerged from our social media campaign.
One notable success was our ambassador campaign. Despite starting the campaign later than we intended, our ambassadors were able to generate more post interactions than our page posts. This highlights the effectiveness of using ambassadors to reach our target audience, as they have already established credibility and a strong connection with our intended demographic. <br><br>
			  
In terms of reactions, we have mostly received heart reactions and way less likes and other types of reactions. The hearts depict the wholesomeness of our content, and it shows that the few people that have seen it really care about the message. On few of the posts we also received the Care reaction, which ideally shows that the people who gave it truly care and show support. In terms of likes, they come in second after the hearts, which shows a general feeling of appreciation. When it comes to reach, it is steady, with our first post having reached the greatest number of people because it has been online for the longest time. <br><br>
			  
Our main ambassador is a very influential woman located in Varna, Bulgaria that leads a self-sufficient and adventurous lifestyle. Throughout the campaign, she tagged our page and used our special brand hashtags to direct people to our page. She has on average 100 reactions per post. Through her, we have had a few people join our community. 
.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Looking back on the campaign, we can see that we had some successes and some areas for improvement. Our targeting and messaging were effective in reaching our desired audience, and our ambassador campaign generated strong engagement. However, we also experienced challenges with not posting frequently enough and not using a variety of content forms.
If the campaign were to continue, we would focus: 
</p>
          <p>If the campaign were to continue, we would focus: </p>
            <ul>
			<li>On the increase the frequency of our page posts to at least once per day, with a mix of different content formats (photos, videos, quizzes, etc.) </li>	
			<li>Continue to use ambassadors but incorporate more explicit call to action messages in their posts to drive traffic to the brand page. </li>
			<li> Increase the use of Facebook hashtags to increase our reach and visibility. </li>
			<li> Expand our use of other social media platforms like Instagram. </li>
			<li> Use more analytics tools to track campaign performance and optimize messaging and targeting as needed.</li>

          <h3 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions (For justifications check Appendix 2)</h3>
          <br>
			<p> Through the two round of interviews we encountered several moments in which we had to alter some of the decisions we had made hence we had the following Pivots:<br>
			<br>
			At the beginning stage, our focus was directed towards either Independent Middle-aged singles or middle-aged singles looking for love. After the first interviews, we decided to expand our market and focus on both. For initial solutions, we had seminars and advertising agencies. However, we pivoted into a traveling cruise after we received feedback from potential customers that they wanted a more interactive and engaging experience. Initially, we had planned to buy a ship, but after conducting market research, we found out that the price of a cruise ship was too high for us to afford. Instead, we decided to pursue a 50/50 partnership with a cruise line, where we split profits. This allowed us to make ticket prices more affordable and spend less money. Buying the ship itself would have been unsustainable for us. 
<br><br>
			During the pre-interviews stage and first interviews, we found out that middle-aged singles have limited options and that's why they don't meet people. However, we also discovered that the reason they do not meet people is because of their busy schedules. As we moved to the validation stage, our perception began to shift as we gathered more information and feedback from potential customers. We had to adjust our lean canvas to incorporate what we learned from customer interviews and market research. In the iteration stage, our perception continued to evolve as we tested and refined our product or service. We had to be open to pivoting our approach based on user feedback and market demand. This required us to adjust our lean canvas again, incorporating new assumptions and hypotheses based on the changes we made to our product or service. 
<br><br>
			In the final stage of our startup journey, we were focused on scaling our business and reaching a larger market. We adjusted our lean canvas to reflect changes in our operations and marketing strategies, such as increasing our social media presence and partnering with local travel agencies to promote our cruise. We also added new features to our cruise, such as speed dating events and cooking classes, to better meet the needs of our customers. These changes would allow us to attract a wider audience and generate more revenue.

			 <li> Poor work-life balance: Middle-aged singles may struggle to balance their work and personal lives. They may feel overwhelmed with the demands of their job and may not have enough time for their hobbies, leisure activities, and spending time with family and friends. This can lead to feelings of stress and burnout.   </li>
			  <li>Limited social circle: Middle-aged singles may have a limited social circle due to the busy nature of their lives. They may not have enough time or opportunities to meet new people and expand their social circle.

			   <h4> <em>Problem </em></h4>
            <p> <em>Not enough time </em><br>
			From our final conducted interview we found out that Middle-aged singles are typically very busy with work, family obligations, and other responsibilities. They often find it difficult to balance their time between their personal and professional lives. This can make it challenging for them to find time to socialize and meet new people. Current alternatives are speed dating apps, online dating apps  </p>
			
			<p> <em>Not enough exposure to events happening around them. </em><br>
			According to our interviews, middle-aged singles may not be aware of events because advertising is not reaching them effectively. Traditional forms of advertising, such as TV commercials and print ads, may not be targeting this demographic appropriately. For instance, TV ads can be effective if they are aired during weekends when middle-aged singles are more likely to be at home. Additionally, some of our interviewees reported listening to the radio during their commute to work, which could be a suitable advertising channel for reaching this demographic. Therefore, it is essential to target advertising efforts to channels that middle-aged singles are likely to use and engage with. Current alternatives to this issue are social media platforms like Facebook, instagram as well as Online event directories like Eventbrite and Meetup allow middle-aged singles to search and discover a variety of events and activities  </p>
			
			<p> <em> Feeling alone  </em><br>
			Based on our interviews, middle-aged singles often do not have many opportunities to meet new people outside of work. When they are not working, they may feel too tired to socialize or meet new people, which can make it challenging to build new relationships. This feeling of fatigue and lack of energy can be due to the demands of their work and personal lives, as they often have many responsibilities and obligations to attend to. As a result, they may feel isolated and lonely, which can negatively impact their mental health and overall wellbeing. It is essential to consider these factors when designing a product or service that targets middle-aged singles. Current alternatives to this issue are Support groups like Meetup's "50+ Singles and Mature Dating" provide a platform for middle-aged singles to connect with others as well as volunteer opportunities through organizations like AARP or local charities provide a chance for middle-aged singles to meet new people while contributing to a cause they care about.   </p>
