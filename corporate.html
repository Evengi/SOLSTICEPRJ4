          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h3 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
          <p>In order to achieve our campaign objectives, we at Solstice, have carefully crafted our messaging to resonate with our target audience. Our focus on the theme of "Choice" is intended to empower middle-aged singles to take control of their lives and pursue the relationships and experiences that they desire. <br>
<br>
To ensure that our messaging is effective, we have enlisted the help of brand ambassadors who are themselves members of our target audience. These ambassadors help to further spread our message by sharing our posts on their own Facebook pages, thereby increasing our reach and engaging with more people. Our plan is to post Mondays and Fridays and allow the ambassadors to post on Saturdays and Sundays. Through this we have four consecutive days of posting which should produce a larger user engagement throughout the week. <br><br>

To maximize the impact of our campaign, we want to utilize Facebook's targeting options to reach our desired audience based on key demographics, interests, and behaviors. By doing so, we can ensure that our messaging is reaching those who are most likely to be interested in our brand and its offerings.<br><br>

To measure the success of our campaign, we have set specific goals for reach and engagement. Our target is to reach at least 50 people from our target audience and generate on average 75 post interactions. By monitoring our campaign performance closely and making adjustments as necessary, we are confident that we can achieve these goals and create a lasting impact on our target audience.<br><br>

The reactions that our posts receive, such as likes, loves, and wows, can provide valuable feedback on how our messaging is resonating with our target audience. A post that receives a high number of likes and loves indicates that it is being well received and resonating with our audience, while a post that receives a low number of reactions may indicate that we need to adjust our messaging or targeting.<br><br>

The reactions on our posts can also serve as a way to build social proof, which is an important factor in consumer decision making. When our posts receive a high number of positive reactions, such as likes and loves, it can create a sense of social validation and encourage others to engage with our brand and its offerings
By closely monitoring the reactions on our posts, we can gain valuable insights into how our target audience is responding to our messaging and make adjustments as necessary. This can help us to optimize our campaign performance and achieve our goals of reaching at least 50 people from our target audience and generating on average 75 post interactions.<br><br>

In addition to measuring post reactions, we will also monitor the comments and shares on our Facebook posts as part of our response objectives. Comments and shares can provide valuable feedback and insights into how our target audience is engaging with our brand and messaging. We monitor the comments section for any negative feedback or comments and address them promptly and respectfully.<br><br>

For shares, our response objectives include monitoring the number of shares our posts receive as an indicator of their relevance and resonance with our target audience, tracking the sentiment of shared posts and engaging with users who have shared our content with positive feedback or comments and encouraging more shares by creating content that is shareable and easily digestible, and by including clear calls-to-action that prompt users to share with their networks.<br><br>

By monitoring comments and shares on our Facebook posts, we can gain valuable insights into how our target audience is engaging with our brand and messaging and adjust our strategy as necessary.<br><br>

To further expand our reach and engagement on Facebook, we will also include relevant hashtags in our posts as part of our social media strategy. Hashtags can help our content get discovered by users who are searching for specific topics or keywords on Facebook.<br><br>
			  

Our hashtag strategy will include researching and identifying relevant and popular hashtags within our target audience's interests and behaviors. We also incorporate 3-4 hashtags per post that are relevant to the content and align with our brand's messaging and personality. Lastly, we encourage users to use our branded hashtag in their own posts and user-generated content to increase brand awareness and engagement.<br><br>

By strategically using hashtags in our Facebook posts, we can increase our visibility and reach to users who may not be following our brand's page, but are interested in the topics we are discussing. Additionally, by creating a branded hashtag, we can encourage our target audience to engage with our brand and share their experiences and perspectives with others.<br><br>

Overall, our Marketing Communication campaign on Facebook is designed to empower and inspire middle-aged singles to embrace their independence and pursue their desired relationships and experiences. By delivering relevant and engaging messaging through a variety of formats, and utilizing Facebook's targeting options and brand ambassadors, we are confident that we can achieve our campaign objectives and create a lasting impact on our target audience.<br><br>
          </p>
		<h4> Target audience </h4>	
			<p>Our target audience is middle-aged singles between the ages of 35-60. This demographic is active on social media, as they are at a stage in their lives where they are looking for new connections and experiences.<br><br>
				
In terms of media behavior, our target audience uses a variety of social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. They also use dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble to meet new people. However, Facebook is the most popular platform among our target audience, as it is a well-established social media platform with a diverse user base.<br><br>
				
To position our message effectively, we need to understand our target audience's interests and preferences. We will focus on creating content that speaks directly to their needs and aspirations and use a tone that is friendly and relatable. Our messaging will highlight the benefits of being independent and embracing choice and inspire our target audience to take action towards finding new connections and experiences.<br><br>
				
Our target audience visits social media platforms during their free time, which is in the evenings or on weekends. We aim to post content during these times to maximize engagement and reach.
By understanding our target audience's media behavior, interests, and values, we can create a marketing communication campaign that resonates with them and inspires them to take action towards finding new connections and experiences.
</p>
          <h3 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Execution and Learning Points </h3>
          <p>The list of shortcomings we have identified in our social media strategy is quite extensive, and it's clear that we have a lot of room for improvement.<br>
<br>
 Perhaps the most significant issue is our overestimation of Facebook's algorithm, especially when compared to newer platforms like Instagram and TikTok. This has likely contributed to a lack of engagement and reach on our posts, which in turn has hindered our ability to connect with our target audience.<br><br>
			  
Another area where we have fallen short is our frequency of posting. By not posting often enough, we are missing out on valuable opportunities to engage with our followers and build a relationship with them. Additionally, by not posting at the designated timeslots that are most efficient for our target audience, we are missing out on potential engagement and reach. To be more specific, we didn’t post in all the four consecutive days throughout the execution weeks. <br><br>
			  
While we have been relying heavily on ambassador posts to drive engagement, we recognize that this is not enough to sustain a successful social media campaign. The ambassador shared posts from their personal life, which perfectly captured the essence of our values and brand. Furthermore, we have not been utilizing ambassadors who have company accounts, as we do not have access to their analytics. This is a missed opportunity, as these accounts could potentially drive significant traffic to our brand page.<br><br>
			  
Yet, we should have diversified our content and incorporated various forms, such as videos, quizzes, and other interactive features, to keep our audience engaged and interested. We, as a brand, didn’t have any interactive messages, such as videos or quizzes, and we only posted pictures with captions. Due to the fact that we stuck with the same material, we didn’t receive the attention we hoped for. It became monotonous and we should have diversified our content to increase the engagement.<br><br>
			  
We still don’t have a post that outreached the previous ones, which means that we still haven’t found the proper way to communicate with our target audience.<br><br>
			  
Furthermore, we have not been using explicit call-to-action messages in our ambassador posts, which is a crucial aspect of any successful social media campaign. By failing to include clear instructions on what our audience should do after reading our posts, we are not effectively generating traffic to our brand page.<br><br>
			  
In summary, we have identified several areas where our social media strategy needs improvement. We recognize the importance of adapting to the changing social media landscape and utilizing a diverse range of content formats to engage with our target audience effectively. We will continue to monitor our strategy closely and optimize it as necessary to ensure we are delivering the best possible results for our brand.<br><br>

Despite some areas for improvement, there were also some positive learning points that emerged from our social media campaign.
One notable success was our ambassador campaign. Despite starting the campaign later than we intended, our ambassadors were able to generate more post interactions than our page posts. This highlights the effectiveness of using ambassadors to reach our target audience, as they have already established credibility and a strong connection with our intended demographic. <br><br>
			  
In terms of reactions, we have mostly received heart reactions and way less likes and other types of reactions. The hearts depict the wholesomeness of our content, and it shows that the few people that have seen it really care about the message. On few of the posts we also received the Care reaction, which ideally shows that the people who gave it truly care and show support. In terms of likes, they come in second after the hearts, which shows a general feeling of appreciation. When it comes to reach, it is steady, with our first post having reached the greatest number of people because it has been online for the longest time. <br><br>
			  
Our main ambassador is a very influential woman located in Varna, Bulgaria that leads a self-sufficient and adventurous lifestyle. Throughout the campaign, she tagged our page and used our special brand hashtags to direct people to our page. She has on average 100 reactions per post. Through her, we have had a few people join our community.
